- Hi, Iâ€™m Abby! ðŸ‘‹ 
- My pronouns are she/her/hers.
- Iâ€™m currently a K-5 music teacher but have always been interested in web design, so I'm currently studying HTML/CSS with Skillcrush.
- I love dogs, lattes (but sadly, I have to stick to decaf), and am learning to speak Dutch right now.
- I'm on the web at abbynyhof.com
